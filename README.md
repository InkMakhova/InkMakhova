Hi! 
I’m @InkMakhova. I’m interested in frontend-technologies and I'd like to find a great job as a frontend-developer.

I’m currently learning JavaScript and React. In my training projects I've already used such technologies as:
- HTML and CSS
- BEM
- LESS/SASS
- Adaptive/Responsive design
- JS (ES6)
- React
- Redux
- Gulp, WebPack
